## **1. Research Focus and Relevance**

This document provides a summary of the study conducted by Maximilian Konradt and Beatrice Weder di Mauro.

The study focuses on the empirical evaluation of the effects of carbon pricing on inflation. It examines whether the introduction and increase of carbon taxes over the past three decades have contributed to overall inflationary pressure, a phenomenon often referred to as **“greenflation”**.

The transition to a decarbonized economy is raising growing concerns among policymakers, markets, and the public. These concerns have intensified following the rise in energy prices after the COVID‑19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Institutions such as the European Central Bank (ECB) have emphasized that climate policies could require a reassessment of monetary policy operations if they were to generate persistent inflationary pressures.

## **2. What Is Known and What Is Not Known (and Why It Matters)**

Although the literature extensively documents the contractionary and inflationary effects of oil price shocks, carbon taxes have distinct characteristics that require separate analysis:

- Typical energy shocks (such as those observed in 2022) are **much larger** than observed or planned carbon taxes (often between \$100 and \$200 per ton).  
- Unlike sudden oil shocks, carbon taxes are **announced in advance** with scheduled price paths, allowing economic agents to adjust.  
- Many carbon taxes are **revenue‑neutral**, redistributing revenues to households or firms, which may mitigate the overall tax burden.

However, uncertainty remains because most previous studies relied on **simulations** rather than **historical empirical data**.

## **4. Empirical Approach**

The authors use a **local projections methodology** (Jordà, 2005) adapted to panel data to estimate the dynamic impulse responses of inflation to changes in carbon tax rates.

### **Baseline Model**

The baseline model consists of a sequence of OLS regressions:



$$
\Delta CPI_{i,t+h} = \alpha_i + \theta_h \tau_{i,t} + \beta(L)\tau_{i,t-1} + \delta(L)\Delta CPI_{i,t-1} + \phi(L)\Delta X_{i,t-1} + \psi_t + \epsilon_{i,t+h}
$$




Where:

- **ΔCPIᵢ,ₜ₊ₕ**: change in annual inflation in economy *i* at horizon *h*  
- **τᵢ,ₜ**: real carbon tax rate  
- **θₕ**: effect of an unexpected carbon tax change after *h* years  
- **Xᵢ,ₜ₋₁**: control variables (GDP growth, interest rates, employment, etc.)  
- **αᵢ**, **ψₜ**: country and year fixed effects  

The study simulates a counterfactual scenario involving a **permanent \$40 per ton CO₂ increase** covering **30%** of an economy’s emissions. Using Jordà’s method, the authors compute the difference between two forecasts (with and without a carbon tax change) to isolate the specific effect of the tax on inflation.

The analysis covers:

- 15 national carbon taxes in Europe  
- 3 provincial taxes in Canada (BC, Quebec, Alberta)  
- Data from **1985–2018**  
- Headline, core, and energy/food inflation components

## **6. Results**

The study concludes that **carbon taxes did not lead to a significant increase in overall inflation**.

1. **Europe:**  
   - Cumulative response of headline inflation after 5 years ≈ **0.5 percentage points**, but confidence intervals include zero.  
   - **Canada:** results suggest slightly **deflationary** responses.

2. **Price structure changes:**  
   - Carbon taxes increase **energy and food prices**,  
   - but have **no effect on core inflation**.

3. **Heterogeneity:**  
   - Inflation is lower in countries practicing **revenue recycling**.  
   - Countries with more independent central banks show **muted inflationary responses**.

### **Summary Table**

| Inflation Component | Europe (horizon 0) | Canada (horizon 0) |
|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Headline            | 0.05% (with controls) | 0.03% (with controls) |
| Core                | 0.10% | -0.33% |
| Energy & Food       | 1.00% | 1.36% |

These results indicate that carbon taxation acts as a **relative price adjustment mechanism**, not a driver of generalized inflation. The absence of spillovers from energy to the rest of the consumption basket suggests that the macroeconomic costs of historical carbon taxes have been limited.

The potential deflationary effects in Canada may stem from lower household disposable income or reduced demand for energy‑intensive durable goods.

## **8. Contribution of the Study**

This research is the **first comprehensive empirical analysis** of the inflationary consequences of carbon taxation. It complements Metcalf and Stock (2020) by confirming the **macroeconomic neutrality** of carbon taxes.

It also distinguishes the effects of **national carbon taxes** from those of the **EU ETS**, which is more volatile and less predictable.
