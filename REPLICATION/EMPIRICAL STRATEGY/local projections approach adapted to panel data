# A Local Projections Approach to Difference-in-Differences

## Specification 1. Static two-way fixed-effects regression (static TWFE)

y_it = α_i^STWFE + δ_t^STWFE + β^STWFE · D_it + e_it^STWFE   (2)

where α_i are unit-specific intercepts and δ_t are common time-specific intercepts.
e_it denotes the error term.

## Specification 2. Dynamic two-way fixed-effects regression (dynamic TWFE)

y_it = α_i^ETWFE + δ_t^ETWFE
     + Σ_{h = −Q}^{H} γ_h^ETWFE · D_{i,t−h}
     + e_it^ETWFE ,   Q, H ≥ 0   (3)

where:

β_h^ETWFE = Σ_{j = 0}^{h} γ_j^ETWFE

is the dynamic TWFE estimate for the effect at horizon h after treatment
(0 ≤ h ≤ H), and

β_{−h}^ETWFE = − Σ_{j = −h}^{−1} γ_j^ETWFE

is an estimate of possible pre-trends at horizon h before treatment
(−Q ≤ h ≤ −1).

## Specification 3. Local Projections regression (LP)

y_{i,t+h} − y_{i,t−1}
= δ_t^h + β_h^LP · ΔD_it + e_it^h ,

for h = −Q, … , 0 , … , H ; Q, H ≥ 0 ; h ≠ −1   (4)

As a result of the differencing, the LP specification does not include unit fixed effects.
Moreover, a separate regression is estimated for each time horizon h.

To summarize: with staggered treatment, a naive LP regression may suffer from the
"negative weights" problem highlighted by recent studies, arising from unclear
comparisons using previously treated units as controls.

## LP-DiD Estimator

Key idea: restrict comparisons to **clean** treated and control units.

---

## LP-DiD Regression

Estimate the regression:

y_{i,t+h} − y_{i,t−1}
= β_h^{LP-DiD} · ΔD_it
+ δ_t^h
+ e_it^h

for h = −Q, … , 0 , … , H

Restrict the estimation sample to observations that are either:

• Newly treated:
  ΔD_it = 1

• Clean control:
  D_{i,t+h} = 0
