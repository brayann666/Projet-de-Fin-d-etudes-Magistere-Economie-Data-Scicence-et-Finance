## **Important Notes on Timing**

- **Europe:**  
  Although the main sample starts in 1985, some additional control variables (employment, trade balance) are only available from 1990 onward, slightly reducing the scope of certain model specifications.

- **Canada:**  
  The analysis covers all 10 provinces since 2000, using both annual and quarterly data to test short‑term responsiveness.

- **Tax implementation waves:**  
  - Early 1990s: Scandinavian countries  
  - Post‑2000: Switzerland, Ireland  
  - Post‑2010: United Kingdom, France, Spain
